# Instruction for Candidates

**This is a rough start to what should be in the README.md file.**

Welcome, we look forward to getting to know you. 

As part of our job application process, we are asking candidates to modify an existing Web site to showcase themselves and their job skills. 

You will receive an invitation to a repository for your individual Web site. Please do the following:

1. Change your name and bio in the _config.toml_ file
2. A more extensive bio can go into the About page (in the content folder),
3. Your test answers should go into the pages reserved for them, and
4. Your blog posts can be additional research and information that you have done. 

Please do **NOT**:
1. Modify the theme or the look and feel of the site,
2. Add vulnerabilities or exploits to the sites, or
3. Overwhelm us with information.

Be concise. Provide us with the most relevant details.

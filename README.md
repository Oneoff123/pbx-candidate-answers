# Instruction for Candidates

Welcome, we look forward to getting to know you. 

As part of our job application process, we are asking candidates to modify an existing Web site so as to showcase themselves and their job skills. 

Please do the following:

1. Change your name and bio in the _config.toml_ file
2. Edit the About page (found in the content folder) to provide a more extensive bio,
3. Edit the pages in the Challenges folder to provide your test answers, and
4. Add blog posts to provide information about additional research and anything else you think we should know.

When you are done, please commit and push the changes.

Feel free to improve (with customisations or new features) the Hugo theme provided. Part of the exercise is for you to show us your technical skills.

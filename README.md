# Instruction for Candidates

**This is a rough start to what should be in the README.md file.**

Welcome, we look forward to getting to know you. 

As part of our job application process, we are asking candidates to modify an existing Web site so as to showcase themselves and their job skills. 

You will receive an invitation to a repository for your individual Web site. Please do the following:

1. Change your name and bio in the _config.toml_ file
2. Edit the About page (found in the content folder) to provide a more extensive bio,
3. Edit the pages in the Challenges folder to provide your test answers, and
4. Add blog posts to provide information about additional research and anything else you think we should know.

When you are done, please commit and push the changes.

Please do **NOT**:
1. Modify the theme or the look and feel of the site,
2. Add vulnerabilities or exploits to the sites, or
3. Overwhelm us with information.

Be concise. Provide us with the most relevant details.
